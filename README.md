# Bees Challenge

Technical challenge with solutions to everyday problems.

## Description

The project is composed of two screens, the first one is validating the inputs with yup to verify the age of majority and invalid or unfilled characters. On the breweries display screen we have 6 API items with the option to delete each one of them or add a tag by clicking on the add more icon. In the header, the name is managed by a context and a toast was created for user notifications.
